Xlog is a very powerful tool for note taking. the official distribution include tools for:

- capture screenshots
- record audio and video
- record screencasts
- upload files

It also converts text to link if it includes another page name. without explicit linking.

Xlog also stores all the data in the filesystem. so no special applications/servers required like databases.
